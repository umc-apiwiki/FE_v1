# Language and Communication Preferences

- **Primary Language**: All Pull Request (PR) descriptions, titles, and review comments must be written in **Korean**.
- **Technical Terminology**:
  - Keep technical terms (e.g., "Dependency Injection", "Middleware", "Props", "State Management") in their original English form or provide them in parentheses alongside the Korean translation.
  - Example: "컴포넌트의 상태(State)를 관리하는 로직을 수정했습니다."
- **Tone and Style**:
  - Use a professional yet friendly tone (e.g., "~합니다", "~하세요").
  - Be concise and focus on "Why" and "How" when describing changes.

# PR Description Guidelines

When generating PR descriptions:

1. Start with a brief summary of the changes in Korean.
2. Use a bulleted list to explain key updates.
3. If there are breaking changes, highlight them clearly with a "주의 사항" or "중요 변경 사항" section.

# Code Review Guidelines

When providing code reviews or suggestions:

1. Explain the reasoning behind the suggestion in Korean.
2. Ensure technical terms are used accurately in English where appropriate to avoid confusion.
3. Focus on readability, performance, and best practices.
